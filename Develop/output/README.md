## Description

My motivation for this project is to learn how to develop a project using node.js and to make a tool that I can use going forward with my bootcamp experience.  The problem it solves it creates a resuable dynamic readme file generator.  I learned how to interact with node.js and the inquirer package.

## Credits

To get the list of licenses for the badges and the URL's for each license I did a google search and came across the following search https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba.  I clicked on the the raw version for this site, I copied and papasted the information concerning the dfferent licenses into a text file.  I then wrote an apple script file to parse out the data from the text file and conrverted that infromation into a json strstriring  and saved the file.
